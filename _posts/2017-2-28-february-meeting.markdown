title:  "February 2017 Meeting"

For this meeting, in lieu of a traditional reading and discussion, we planned a more practical "hands-on" workshop and sent out a common dataset--a zip file of all 58 Presidential Inaugural Addresses--inviting participants to analyze/explore this data by using a DH tool or method of their choice. We hoped this exercise might be, for beginners, a chance to dip a toe into DH waters, and for veterans, the chance to try something new (or something old in a new way) and share it with the rest of us.
